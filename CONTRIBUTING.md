Contributions of issues, pull requests, automated unit tests and good questions
are encouraged.

Development has slowed in the main driusan/bug repository.

As a policy when submitting new functionality, tests of the functionality
should be added to the automated test suite. We use codecov and strive to
increase the test coverage of the code.

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately via email to
grantbow+fit@gmail.com (preferred) or via the regular bug reporting process.

Please try to google for how to do so if you haven't done this before but don't
let this step stop you from contributing something. Other project contributing

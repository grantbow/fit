Contributions of issues, pull requests, automated unit tests and good questions
are encouraged.

Many small tasks can be performed by new or casual contributors. Using the program
and providing FEEDBACK.md is something anyone can do. Grammar and typos are still
being found and generated, so reporting these is greatly appreciated.

As a policy, when submitting new functionality tests of the functionality
must be added to the automated test suite. We use codecov and strive to
increase the test coverage of the code to at least 80% coverage.

As a policy, code should follow recommendations from
https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html and
https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments

Code reviews submitted to the project owner are performed and later checked by
all contributors. The project owner will review the proposed modifications and
apply them to the code for release in the next version of the software. New
features must be accompanied by new tests added to the automated test suite.

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately via email to
grantbow+fit@gmail.com (preferred) or via the regular bug reporting process.

driusan/bugs has osx and linux binaries : https://github.com/driusan/bug/releases/

https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/

doesn't seem right unless I publish an API key.

I release 0.5 https://github.com/grantbow/bug/releases/ but didn't append binary files.

binary files may be convenient in some circumstances but
this can not be cleanly handled.

#### What did you do?

fit import <jira url>

#### What did you expect to see?

import the issues


#### What did you see instead?

<nothing yet>

#### What version?



#### notes:

find the url
find the way a user will most easily find the url
how to provide the url
    configuration is better than a cli argument because
    it doesn't change and will be reusable.
implement a mvp
    look for the taxonomy of tags that are needed
    with the number of tag keys planned
    making the system generic seems reasonable instead of
    just supporting the existing four special values with similar implementations.
    dynamic lists of keys is already implemented, so using that as a basis for loops
    instead of hard coded exceptions feels expandable and reasonable.
make using the import easier

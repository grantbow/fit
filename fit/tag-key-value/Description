#### What did you do?
fit create -n issue one
fit tag 1 Status closed

#### What did you expect to see?
create file fit/issue_one/Status with "closed" content or
create file fit/issue_one/tag_status_closed


#### What did you see instead?
The fit tag command was designed to add boolean values only.
Fit tag command creates empty files by default in the tags directory.

    $ls fit/issue_one/tags/
    Status  closed

and with --rm removes boolean tags.

#### What version?
0.6


#### notes:
the original implementation
makes renaming or removing the existing tag command required

When removing the Tag function other parts of the test suite
broke. As this convention is long standing more work is required
to bring it current.

Hi. I think it's much better for close command to actually move the closed
issue into issues/closed directory instead of deleting them, for future
reference in case the same issue occurs again.



#### What did you do?
$ mkdir test && cd test
$ git init
$ mkdir fit
$ fit create -n foo
$ fit list
$ git add fit/foo/Description
$ git commit <in editor add "bug foo" and save>
$ fit close 1


#### What did you see?
fit/foo directory is deleted


#### What did you expect to see?
fit/foo is moved/renamed to fit/closed/foo


#### What version?

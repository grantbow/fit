===== WARNING, path from git to issues: /cmd

===== list /home/grantbow/go/src/github.com/grantbow/fit/cmd/fit

#### What did you expect to see?
fit should always give it's version number, then maybe warn about the environment.
Special case to turn off checking for these errors should be coded for this and
    perhaps the env command.
Some variables for the dir name and program name need to be used
    better in this and likely other error messages.

This part may only be a problem in the fit distribution.
Fit looks for both a fit directory and/or an issues directory.
When directories exist with those names that are not intended
for issue/bug reports the warnings should be more helpful.
The issue/fit/bug dir name and program name variables need to be used.


#### What version?
0.6

All unix shell arguments that contain special characters, which many
regular expressions use, must be escaped. This prevents the automatic
"filename expansion" or "globbing" performed by the shell before
launching the fit command. A good references with details are at:
http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/globbingref.html
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html

will print.  See "fit help ids" for what makes a IssueID.
